	<p style="font-size:150%; color:red">Practicing HTML is fun. <br>So far we have learned 
	<strong>HTML</strong> is a language made of tags that 
	help us describe how we want our webpages to look. 
	We have tried the <em>head, title, H(heading),</em>
	 and paragraph tags so far. <br>
	Very few people know all the tags in HTML, but that is okay
	because we can do a lot with just some basic tags. We can learn
	about new tags when we need them.</p>
